Focal is an exciting experimental platform for musicians using Pupil eye tracking add-ons for the the Epson Moverio BT-200.

Focal enables musicians to manage and control electronic effects while both hands are occupied. The musician can control many virtual electronic audio effects and synthesis parameters by fixating on effects displayed in the AR GUI. 

A foot pedal can be used to adjust the selected effects enabling a musician to maintain posture and balance for minimal disturbance during performance. Check out Stewart Greenhill and Cathie Travers full paper for NIME 2016 [here](http://stewartgreenhill.com/documents/FocalEyeTrackingMusicalExpressionController-NIME2016.pdf).
