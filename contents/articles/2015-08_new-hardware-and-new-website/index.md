 We are excited to announce two big updates. 

  - **New Hardware** - Binocular and high speed Pupil hardware is now available!
  - **New Website** - We just launched our new and improved website!

## New Hardware 

Over the past couple of years, we have received requests for a variety of custom hardware setups or modifications to Pupil hardware. Based on these requests, we have decided to leverage Pupil's modular design such that there is no longer just Pupil Pro and Pupil Dev. It is now a configurable platform that will simply be called **Pupil**.

The second big hardware update is the addition of custom made world and eye cameras designed by Pupil Labs. The new world camera is considerably smaller, lighter, comes with exchangeable lenses, and can record 720p footage at 60fps. The new eye camera captures the eye at the high speed of 120fps, a crucial requirement for many fields of research.  

With the new options and our online configurator, you can build the headset you require for your research. For example, you can configure Pupil for egocentric vision research with a high speed camera and no eye camera. Similarly, Pupil can be configured for pupillometry without scene information with monocular or binocular eye cameras and no world camera. Check out all the possible configurations on the store -- [https://pupil-labs.com/store](https://pupil-labs.com/store)

For those of you with an existing Pupil Pro headset, we made an upgrade kit so that you can add 120fps eye capture to your headset (no tools required).        

 
## New Website

With the addition of new hardware, and based on feedback from the community, we found that Pupil had outgrown the old website. 

We will be adding more features and content to the site in the following weeks. Get in touch, and let us know what you think (or if you spot any typos/bugs :).
