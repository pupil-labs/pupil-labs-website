We are excited to share [Yuta Itoh](http://campar.in.tum.de/Main/YutaItoh), [Jason Orlosky](http://www.jeoresearch.com/research), et al.'s open source 3d pupil detection and mapping implementation. The code is written in C++, is easy to compile, and runs on Windows. Check out their repo on [github](https://github.com/YutaItoh/3D-Eye-Tracker).

Their software is compatible with Pupil hardware and enables one to obtain the following:

- 3d Gaze normal vector
- 3d eyeball center w.r.t the camera
- Pupil diameter in mm
- 2d pupil ellipse size in pixels
- 2d pupil ellipse angle in degrees
- Coming soon - glint positions
