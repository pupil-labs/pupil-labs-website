We have been doing a lot of work recently on the back-end of Pupil Capture and Player, which will allow for much greater control in the way video and audio are captured, encoded, and decoded. While back-end changes are not yet available for use, we just wanted to say that we're working on it and hope to release changes within the next few weeks.

## Pupil Player
We have just completed some incremental updates for Pupil Player in the offline marker detector plugin. Download Player and try it out for yourself by with our sample recording below.

Here is an overview of new features:

+ Surface and gaze metrics reports saved as .csv files
+ Surface metrics and visualizations within Pupil Player
+ Option to use markers in the scene to set trim marks for automated video export

Heat maps are now mapped onto the surfaces within Pupil Player during playback. Above we show a screenshot of the sample recording with heatmaps -- try it for yourself!

We did notice that some markers that we used in our sample recording did not have enough of a white border around them, which results in surface jitter. You can scale the markers to different sizes, but make sure to have a white border width of at least 1.2 x the marker grid size for marker stickers.   

## Sample data 
Sample data of gaze metrics and surface metric reports generated by Pupil Player for the sample recording. Below tables show overviews for the full duration of the sample video - to see all metrics download the recording.
