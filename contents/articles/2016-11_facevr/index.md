[Justus Thies](http://lgdv.cs.fau.de/people/card/justus/thies/) et al., have developed a novel approach for real-time gaze-aware facial capture system to drive the photo-realistic reconstructed digital face in virtual reality. Their approach enables facial reenactment that can transfer facial expressions and realistic eye appearance between a source and a target actor video.

Head mounted displays (HMDs) provide immersive renderings of virtual environments. But in order to do so HMDs block the majority of the actor/participant's face. In order to reconstruct the actor/participant's face, Thies et al., use an RGB camera to capture the facial performance of the participant and Pupil Labs's [Oculus Rift DK2 add-on cup](https://pupil-labs.com/store/#vr-ar) to capture eye movements within the HMD. The source actor's facial and eye movement data is then used to drive the photo-realistic facial animations of the target video, therefore enabling gaze-aware facial reenactment.
