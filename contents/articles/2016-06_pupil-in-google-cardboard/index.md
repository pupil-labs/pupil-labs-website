[Eye Square](http://www.eye-square.com/itx/) has combined a Pupil eye tracking headset with Google Cardboard to enable VR product and in-store studies.

To make the demo video, the team hacked together a hardware prototype by cutting small holes in the Google Cardboard viewer and inserting an existing Pupil headset. The Eye Square calibrated using the Pupil Capture's manual marker method, and moved markers to different positions on the Android screen via the FullDive app running on a host computer.

We are excited about this work because it demonstrates how quickly one can put together a prototype with existing hardware and software and can have a working VR + Pupil eye tracking system up and running.

We look forward to seeing the next iterations of this project.
