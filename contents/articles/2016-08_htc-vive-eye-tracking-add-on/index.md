We are happy to announce the release of our eye tracking add-on for the HTC Vive headset!

We went through a number of prototype iterations to explore options for an integration that meets all the criteria that we care about:
  + No occlusion of the user's field of view.
  + High quality eye view for robust tracking.
  + Can be attached to the Vive easily by the user without using any tools.

We are quite pleased with the final version.

It is a snap-fit assembly that requires no tools or modifications to the Vive. We have managed to move all components out of the user's field of view. 

Here is a sample video of the right eye.

The cameras can be connected to the Vive's built in USB port, or directly to your computer using a separate USB cable routed alongside the HMDI tether.

The add-on is fully compatible with Pupil Capture and Pupil Service software. As always, you will have raw access to the video streams if you prefer to build your own pipeline. 

We start taking orders today. We will ship in the first week of September. Check it out in the [store](/store#products)
