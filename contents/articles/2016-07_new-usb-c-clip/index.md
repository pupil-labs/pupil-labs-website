We are excited to announce the release of our new USB C clip for Pupil hardware.

The new clip enables us to connect and power USB 3 devices and extend the modularity of the Pupil platform. It also enables Pupil hardware to connect to more devices - like the next generation of smart phones! 

Upgrading from a USB 2 hub also enables us to ensure that adequate power will be supplied to our hardware, as some hosts impose very conservative limitations on USB 2.

An added bonus of USB C is that it is a symmetric connector. This means no more fiddling around trying to figure out the right way to plug in to the clip.

The new clip will be included in all Pupil headsets. We will supply USB C to USB A (USB 3) cables. Any existing Pupil headsets can be upgraded to use the new clip. 

The upgrade is now availble in the [store](/store).
