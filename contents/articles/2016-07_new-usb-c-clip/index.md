We are excited to share with you our new USB C clip. The benefits of the new USB C clip is that it can power USB 3 devices to provide a more stable connection to run better on all devices, while providing more power to power the host devices. This extends the capability of our modular platform by being able to connect to USB 3 devices, increasing compatibility with other devices for new development

So that we are no longer constrained by the limitations of USB 2.
