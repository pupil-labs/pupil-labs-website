The article provides a survey of the state-of-the art in eyewear computing and suggests promising future trajectories for eyewear computing research. Here is an excerpt from the article:
<blockquote cite="http://interactions.acm.org/archive/view/may-june-2016/eyewear-computers-for-human-computer-interaction"> "... the open source PUPIL head-mounted eye tracker from Pupil Labs is affordable and fully customizable, and can be implemented for long-term use. In addition, given that the eye cameras are typically high-resolution, they can be used for corneal imaging, which analyzes the scene reflected on the wet surface of the user’s cornea. Corneal imaging can provide contextual information such as details on the user’s attention, the objects and interlocutors with whom they interact, and their surroundings. Taken together, head-worn eye tracking has significant potential to enable a new class of mobile HCI applications, in particular when combined with other smart eyewear such as head-mounted displays (HMDs)." (p 70)
