Pupil is now in SPACE! Two Pupil headset went up to the ISS on Soyuz 44s.

Pupil Labs created custom egocentric vision Pupil headsets -- world camera only -- that have been successfully integrated into the Mobile Procedure Viewer (mobiPV) project. This project is funded by the European Space Agency (ESA) and was developed by [Space Applications Services][1] in collaboration with Skytek:

"The mobiPV flight segment is a wrist-mounted Android smartphone integrated with a Pupil egocentric vision headset coupled with an iPad providing 'assistive' functions. mobiPV enables astronauts to move about with unlimited mobility, live stream their workspace, share notes, and task progress with specialists at mission control and vice versa; providing an unprecedented task execution and situational awareness solution so far unavailable on the ISS."

We are super excited! Too bad we did not have the smaller camera ready in time for flight certification - it would have looked even cooler :-)
