Happy 2018!

Our first blog post of the year focus on the Pupil community. The community is continuing to grow and there are a lot of exciting projects, scripts, and plugins that have been developed using Pupil.

It is incredibly exciting to see the ecosystem expand and new projects emerge!

### pupil-community

While browsing through github, we found a lot of exciting projects, plugins, and custom scripts that use/extend/build on top of Pupil. 

We thought it would be useful for the community to have a centralized place to share plugins, projects, and scripts developed by the community. Therefore, we decided to create the `pupil-community` reopsitory! 

In the next section we have compiled a _very_ short list of some of the custom plugins, scripts, and projects that we found recently and that were not already feature in this blog. There are likely many more still out there in the wild (e.g. sitting on your hard drive :), so feel free to contribute.

You can submit to the [pupil-community repository](https://github.com/pupil-labs/pupil-community) by making a PR with a link and short description in the README file.
