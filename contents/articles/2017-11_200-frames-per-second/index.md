We are very excited to announce new eye cameras for Pupil Labs hardware! We designed and developed this camera from the ground up. This camera is flexible, small, and fast and will become an integral component in the Pupil eye tracking hardware ecosystem. 

200hz eye camera features:

- Global shutter - Improves pupil detection. 
- Faster - Capture 200 x 200 pixels at 200fps. You can also capture at 400x400 at 120fps. 
- Smaller - Cameras are much smaller. So small that they are barely visible to the wearer.

We're rolling out the new camera updates for Pupil eye tracking headsets first. Over the next few weeks, we will be releasing updates for our VR/AR add-ons. Coming soon - the long awaited Oculus CV1 add-on!
