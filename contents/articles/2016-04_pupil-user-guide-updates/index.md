We have just finished updating Pupil docs so that they cover new features in the v0.7 release. This update includes walkthrough videos for Pupil Capture and Pupil Player, as well as a new getting started guide. 

The Getting Started guide outlines all the steps of a basic workflow with Pupil hardware and software. We hope this guide will be useful for the community. Head over to the [getting started guide](/getting-started).

Check out Pupil Capture walkthrough video for v0.7. More videos are available on the [Pupil Labs YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCO1Dx8T9sym3Dl2grS4fsFA).

Keeping docs up to date with fast-moving software development is a challenge. Pupil is open source and so are the docs! We appreciate all the community contributions that have been made to the documentation so far, and look forward to working more with the community to keep improving the docs. If you'd like to contribute, just head over to the [docs](/docs) - and you can start proposing edits.
