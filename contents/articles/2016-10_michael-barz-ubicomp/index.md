[Michael Barz](https://www.dfki.de/web/kontakt/mitarbeiter?uid=miba01) and [Daniel Sonntag](http://www.dfki.de/~sonntag/) use Pupil to create a real-time gaze-guided object classification system. 

The system they created is comprised of four parts: a Pupil headset, an image classification server, an episodic memory database, and generic interaction manager that receives and exposes generated data from the system.

We are really excited about their work. Their demo application is a great demonstration of how one can use Pupil and the plugin architecture as a foundation for novel prototypes and applications.

An excerpt from their UBICOMP 2016 demo paper below:

<blockquote cite="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=2968219.2971389"> "... Recent advances in eye tracking technologies opened the way to design novel attention-based user interfaces. A system that incorporates the gaze signal and the egocentric camera of the eye tracker to identify the objects the user focuses at for constructing episodic memories of egocentric events in real-time."
</blockquote>
