Pupil is modular - make the headset you need for your research.

If we don’t have the configuration you need, customize it yourself. Our camera mount geometry and electrical interface [is open][1]. 

We also like work with users to create custom solutions. [Get in touch][2]!

If you're excited about SMD soldering and hacking: you can [buy a DEV frame][5], [buy parts][4], and [follow assembly instructions][3] to build your own Pupil DEV headset.
