We are looking to hire paid interns to work at Pupil Labs. We are accepting internship applications on a rolling basis.

Internships are project based. This means that as an intern at Pupil Labs you will be in charge of your own project, and will work closely with our team in the process of development. Projects will be designed such that they can be completed within the internship period. Ideal internship periods are for 6 months working at our office in Berlin.

Send us a project proposal!
