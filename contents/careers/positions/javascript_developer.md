We are looking to hire a part-time Javascript developer to join our team. Remote work is OK, but on-site in Bangkok is preferred.

You are excited about the future of the web and Javascript. You have solid javascript fundamentals; this means you enjoy writing vanilla js. You care equally about performance and user experience. You care deeply about writing code that is a pleasure for others to read. You have experience developing web components (e.g. polymer). You have experience with real time databases (e.g. firebase) and the google cloud computing stack. You are an excellent communicator and work well in a team.
